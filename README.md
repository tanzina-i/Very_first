# Very_first
My first time on Git. 

This code creates a palindrome from an input string. 
Our output results in the palindrome, and the number of operations required to reach that palindrome.

Start with an empty string where we will store the palindrome.

Start with a variable that will count the sum of the operations.

Use if-else statements.
